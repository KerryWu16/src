# ELEC-6910P
Autumn 2016, Aerial Robotics taught by Prof. Shaojie Shen, ELEC-6910P. Design a cascaded PID controller for a quadcopter and plan out the navigation path.

Project 1: Write the upper loop of cascaded PID for position control, and a minimal snap trajectory generation with a perfect state feedback.
Project 2: Run in simulation, finish a tag dectector for PnP and an Extended Kalman Filter for IMU-vision state estimation.
Project 3: Run the code in a quadropter made by ourself.
